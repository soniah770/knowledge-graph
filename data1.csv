SQL Tutorial,SQL Data Types,"Data types and ranges for Microsoft Access, MySQL and SQL Server."
Introduction to SQL,What is SQL?,"SQL stands for Structured Query Language SQL lets you access and manipulate SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987databases"
Introduction to SQL,What Can SQL do?,"SQL can execute queries against a database SQL can retrieve data from a database SQL can insert records in a database SQL can update records in a database SQL can delete records from a database SQL can create new databases SQL can create new tables in a database SQL can create stored procedures in a database SQL can create views in a database SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views"
Introduction to SQL,SQL is a Standard - BUT....,"Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language. However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner. Note: Most of the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard!"
Introduction to SQL,Using SQL in Your Web Site,"To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need: An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL) To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP To use SQL to get the data you want To use HTML / CSS to style the page"
Introduction to SQL,RDBMS,"RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access. The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows. Look at the ""Customers"" table Every table is broken up into smaller entities called fields. The fields in the Customers table consist of CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode and Country. A field is a column in a table that is designed to maintain specific information about every record in the table. A record, also called a row, is each individual entry that exists in a table. For example, there are 91 records in the above Customers table. A record is a horizontal entity in a table. A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific field in a table."
SQL Syntax,Database Tables,"A database most often contains one or more tables. Each table is identified by a name (e.g. ""Customers"" or ""Orders""). Tables contain records (rows) with data. In this tutorial we will use the well-known Northwind sample database (included in MS Access and MS SQL Server)."
SQL Syntax,SQL Statements,Most of the actions you need to perform on a database are done with SQL statements.
SQL Syntax,Keep in Mind That,SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: select is the same as SELECT In this tutorial we will write all SQL keywords in upper-case.
SQL Syntax,Semicolon after SQL Statements?,"Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement. Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.In this tutorial, we will use semicolon at the end of each SQL statement."
SQL Syntax,Some of The Most Important SQL Commands,SELECT - extracts data from a database UPDATE - updates data in a database DELETE - deletes data from a database INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database CREATE TABLE - creates a new table ALTER TABLE - modifies a table DROP TABLE - deletes a table CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key) DROP INDEX - deletes an index
SQL SELECT Statement,The SQL SELECT Statement,"The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database. The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set."
SQL SELECT Statement,SELECT Syntax,"Here, column1, column2, ... are the field names of the table you want to select data from. If you want to select all the fields available in the table"
SQL SELECT Statement,SELECT Column Example,"The following SQL statement selects the ""CustomerName"" and ""City"" columns from the ""Customers"" table"
SQL SELECT Statement,SELECT * Example,"The following SQL statement selects all the columns from the ""Customers"" table:"
SQL SELECT DISTINCT Statement,The SQL SELECT DISTINCT Statement,"The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values. Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values."
SQL SELECT DISTINCT Statement,SELECT Example Without DISTINCT,"The following SQL statement selects all (including the duplicates) values from the ""Country"" column in the ""Customers"" table:"
SQL SELECT DISTINCT Statement,SELECT DISTINCT Examples,"The following SQL statement selects only the DISTINCT values from the ""Country"" column in the ""Customers"" table The following SQL statement lists the number of different (distinct) customer countries:"
SQL WHERE Clause,The SQL WHERE Clause,The WHERE clause is used to filter records. It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.
SQL WHERE Clause,WHERE Clause Example,"The following SQL statement selects all the customers from the country ""Mexico"", in the ""Customers"" table:"
SQL WHERE Clause,Text Fields vs. Numeric Fields,"SQL requires single quotes around text values (most database systems will also allow double quotes). However, numeric fields should not be enclosed in quotes"
SQL WHERE Clause,Operators in The WHERE Clause,The following operators can be used in the WHERE clause 
"SQL AND, OR and NOT Operators","The SQL AND, OR and NOT Operators","The WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators. The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE. The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE. The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE."
"SQL AND, OR and NOT Operators",AND Example,"The following SQL statement selects all fields from ""Customers"" where country is ""Germany"" AND city is ""Berlin"":"
"SQL AND, OR and NOT Operators",OR Example,"The following SQL statement selects all fields from ""Customers"" where city is ""Berlin"" OR ""München"" he following SQL statement selects all fields from ""Customers"" where country is ""Germany"" OR ""Spain"
"SQL AND, OR and NOT Operators",NOT Example,"The following SQL statement selects all fields from ""Customers"" where country is NOT ""Germany"
"SQL AND, OR and NOT Operators","Combining AND, OR and NOT","You can also combine the AND, OR and NOT operators. The following SQL statement selects all fields from ""Customers"" where country is ""Germany"" AND city must be ""Berlin"" OR ""München"" (use parenthesis to form complex expressions)"
SQL ORDER BY Keyword,The SQL ORDER BY Keyword,"The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order. The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword."
SQL ORDER BY Keyword,ORDER BY Example,"The following SQL statement selects all customers from the ""Customers"" table, sorted by the ""Country"" column:"
SQL ORDER BY Keyword,ORDER BY DESC Example,"The following SQL statement selects all customers from the ""Customers"" table, sorted DESCENDING by the ""Country"" column:"
SQL ORDER BY Keyword,ORDER BY Several Columns Example,"The following SQL statement selects all customers from the ""Customers"" table, sorted by the ""Country"" and the ""CustomerName"" column. This means that it orders by Country, but if some rows have the same Country, it orders them by CustomerName:"
SQL ORDER BY Keyword,ORDER BY Several Columns Example 2,"The following SQL statement selects all customers from the ""Customers"" table, sorted ascending by the ""Country"" and descending by the ""CustomerName"" column"
SQL INSERT INTO Statement,The SQL INSERT INTO Statement,The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table.
SQL INSERT INTO Statement,INSERT INTO Syntax,"It is possible to write the INSERT INTO statement in two ways: Specify both the column names and the values to be inserted If you are adding values for all the columns of the table, you do not need to specify the column names in the SQL query. However, make sure the order of the values is in the same order as the columns in the table. Here, the INSERT INTO syntax would be as follows"
SQL INSERT INTO Statement,Insert Data Only in Specified Columns,"It is also possible to only insert data in specific columns. The following SQL statement will insert a new record, but only insert data in the ""CustomerName"", ""City"", and ""Country"" columns (CustomerID will be updated automatically)"
SQL NULL Values,What is a NULL Value?,"A field with a NULL value is a field with no value. If a field in a table is optional, it is possible to insert a new record or update a record without adding a value to this field. Then, the field will be saved with a NULL value. Note: A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation!"
SQL NULL Values,How to Test for NULL Values?,"It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>. We will have to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead."
SQL NULL Values,The IS NULL Operator,"The IS NULL operator is used to test for empty values (NULL values). The following SQL lists all customers with a NULL value in the ""Address"" field"
SQL NULL Values,The IS NOT NULL Operator,"The IS NOT NULL operator is used to test for non-empty values (NOT NULL values). The following SQL lists all customers with a value in the ""Address"" field:"
SQL UPDATE Statement,The SQL UPDATE Statement,"The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table Note: Be careful when updating records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the UPDATE statement. The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) that should be updated. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be updated!"
SQL UPDATE Statement,UPDATE Table,The following SQL statement updates the first customer (CustomerID = 1) with a new contact person and a new city.
SQL UPDATE Statement,UPDATE Multiple Records,"It is the WHERE clause that determines how many records will be updated. The following SQL statement will update the ContactName to ""Juan"" for all records where country is ""Mexico"":"
SQL DELETE Statement,The SQL DELETE Statement,The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.
SQL DELETE Statement,SQL DELETE Example,"The following SQL statement deletes the customer ""Alfreds Futterkiste"" from the ""Customers"" table:"
SQL DELETE Statement,Delete All Records,"It is possible to delete all rows in a table without deleting the table. This means that the table structure, attributes, and indexes will be intact"
"SQL TOP, LIMIT, FETCH FIRST or ROWNUM Clause",The SQL SELECT TOP Clause,"The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return. The SELECT TOP clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records. Returning a large number of records can impact performance.Note: Not all database systems support the SELECT TOP clause. MySQL supports the LIMIT clause to select a limited number of records, while Oracle uses FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY and ROWNUM."
"SQL TOP, LIMIT, FETCH FIRST or ROWNUM Clause","SQL TOP, LIMIT and FETCH FIRST Examples","The following SQL statement selects the first three records from the ""Customers"" table (for SQL Server/MS Access):"
"SQL TOP, LIMIT, FETCH FIRST or ROWNUM Clause",SQL TOP PERCENT Example,"The following SQL statement selects the first 50% of the records from the ""Customers"" table (for SQL Server/MS Access):"
"SQL TOP, LIMIT, FETCH FIRST or ROWNUM Clause",ADD a WHERE CLAUSE,"The following SQL statement selects the first three records from the ""Customers"" table, where the country is ""Germany"" (for SQL Server/MS Access):"
SQL MIN() and MAX() Functions,The SQL MIN() and MAX() Functions,The MIN() function returns the smallest value of the selected column. The MAX() function returns the largest value of the selected column.
"SQL COUNT(), AVG() and SUM() Functions","The SQL COUNT(), AVG() and SUM() Functions",The COUNT() function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criterion.
"SQL COUNT(), AVG() and SUM() Functions",COUNT() Example,The following SQL statement finds the number of products
"SQL COUNT(), AVG() and SUM() Functions",AVG() Example,The following SQL statement finds the average price of all products
"SQL COUNT(), AVG() and SUM() Functions",SUM() Example,"The following SQL statement finds the sum of the ""Quantity"" fields in the ""OrderDetails"" table"
SQL LIKE Operator,The SQL LIKE Operator,"The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column. There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator: The percent sign (%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters  The underscore sign (_) represents one, single characterNote: MS Access uses an asterisk (*) instead of the percent sign (%), and a question mark (?) instead of the underscore (_). The percent sign and the underscore can also be used in combinations!"
SQL LIKE Operator,SQL LIKE Examples,The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName starting with 
SQL Wildcards,SQL Wildcard Characters,A wildcard character is used to substitute one or more characters in a string. Wildcard characters are used with the LIKE operator. The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column. All the wildcards can also be used in combinations! Here are some examples showing different LIKE operators with '%' and '_' wildcards
SQL Wildcards,Using the % Wildcard,"The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with ""ber"""
SQL Wildcards,Using the _ Wildcard,"The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with any character, followed by ""ondon"""
SQL Wildcards,Using the [charlist] Wildcard,"The following SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with ""b"", ""s"", or ""p"""
SQL Wildcards,Using the [!charlist] Wildcard,"The two following SQL statements select all customers with a City NOT starting with ""b"", ""s"", or ""p"""
